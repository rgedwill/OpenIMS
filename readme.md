A [conceptually] open source Inventory Management System (IMS) for small, medium, and large retailers. \n

The aim of this tool is to provide a barebones framework for managing the inventory of a store or collection of stores. This project uses deliberately simple libraries in order to stay as accessible and lightweight as possible.

As of the first commit, the following is the entire dependency list of this application:

Django
Django-rest-framework
htmx

TODO:
- linter
- migrate to postgres
- finish 3 core inventory classes
